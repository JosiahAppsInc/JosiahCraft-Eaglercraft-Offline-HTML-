Hello! This is just a simple eaglercraft client that I worte.

It does not work on mobile, but you can play it on a windows/mac computer. To play, just download and open the HTML file on a supported browser (like chrome, firefox, and safari.)
If you have any ideas or bug reports, please contact me in this github form:
